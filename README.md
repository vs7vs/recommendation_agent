# Conversational Fut-Edu Agent

A conversational agent that uses LangGraph and external tools to provide intelligent, context-aware responses and perform tasks.

This project uses a sophisticated graph-based architecture to create a stateful agent capable of complex interactions. It can use tools like web search and website scraping to gather information, reason about it, and even pause to ask the user for clarification before completing its tasks.
